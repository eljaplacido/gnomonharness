# CHANGELOG — gnomon

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Conversation history in `gnomon prompt`.** The loop now replays prior turns,
  driven by the `[context]` block that was already declared (and already
  hashed) in `config.toml` but never read. `policy = "full" | "sliding_window"`,
  `compaction = "discard" | "truncate"`. Failed turns and `<think>` blocks are
  never replayed. History is in-memory for the session — nothing on disk.
- **`[ui]` block in `config.toml`** — configurable meta line (ordered fields
  from `turn`, `role`, `model`, `bucket`, `status`, `duration`, `context`,
  `tokens`, `think`), `meta_style`, chain-of-thought visibility, spinner,
  colour. Rendering moved to `gnomon-core/src/render.ts`, pure and testable.
- **Live progress indicator** with elapsed time, replacing the static
  "… thinking" line. Degrades to one static line on a non-TTY so piped output
  stays greppable.
- **New interactive commands**: `/context`, `/reset`, `/meta`, `/think`.

### Fixed

- **`parseToml` never stripped inline comments**, so every documented value in
  `config.toml` parsed as the whole line — `approval` read as
  `"on_write"   # never | on_write | always`, so no enum value ever matched.
  This made `[context]` unreadable and silently broke `[defaults]`.
- **CI had never run.** `dtolnay/rust-action` does not exist (it is
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`), failing all four Rust jobs at setup; and
  `pnpm/action-setup@v4` hard-errors when `version:` is set alongside
  `packageManager` in `package.json`, failing the TypeScript job. Both fixed;
  `clippy` is now requested explicitly as a toolchain component.
- The "first turn after idle loads the model" hint printed on every turn.
